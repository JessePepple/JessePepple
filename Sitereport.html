    This is my experience as a 100% newbie:<br>
    <br>
    From what I understand, this course is intended for beginners, but after completing first few weeks, I can't say that it is more difficult than i expected.It is possible to complete the work, but if you are true beginner like my self (i.e. someone who has never used or seen HTML, JavaScript, or CSS mark-up language or coding), you might struggle a lot to even understand what the various parts of each language are.<br>
    <br>
    For example, to complete the optional assignment for the the HTML section, I had to pause, search for, and complete the Coursera Introduction to HTML Guided Project which helped me to understand things clearer and i used lecture notes to walk through the process of working with HTML; I took what I learned in the lectures and completed the personal online training in web development with much greater understanding, knowledge, confidence.<br>
    <br>
    If learning is supposed to be the sweet spot between activating or being exposed to knowledge and reaching a clear goal through level-appropriate challenge, I don't think the goal of learning was 100% reached, at least in my case. I Must admit that i was scared at first as some times i found it hard to follow on the lectures and lack of face to face just means that my connection with the lecture is not 100% i do feel like struggling to fit in as a new student also means that i don't have friends i can share questions with and that in it self is a big struggle for me.<br>
    <br>
    The course does emphasize the importance of practice, but it seems to overlook the fact we best practice/manipulate after we are given tools that we understand.I do believe alot of materials have been made available to work with but they are more useful if you understand what you are doing with them.<br>
    <br>
    I have to say this course has been my biggest challenge so far and i have enjoyed it research have been difficult and in some cases very little is explained or i find that language used are very computer orientated for newbies like myself am constantly looking for meanings of stuff and why they are being used. Overall its been great so far and alot of steps to still cover.
